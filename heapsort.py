HeapSort - Max Heap only [sorting in increasing order] [parent node is greater than the values in its two children nodes.]
Definitions :
- perfect/complete binary tree - A binary tree with all leaf nodes at the same depth. All internal nodes have degree 2.
- Note: A perfect binary tree has 2^(n+1)-1 nodes, where n is the height. It can be efficiently implemented as an array, where a node at index i has children at indexes 2i and 2i+1 and a parent at index i/2.
