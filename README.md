Coding with Language of Choice

# PSEUDOCODE STANDARD
  - The "structured" part of pseudocode is a notation for representing six specific structured programming constructs: SEQUENCE, WHILE, IF-THEN-ELSE, REPEAT-UNTIL, FOR, and CASE.
      + **SEQUENCE** is a linear progression where one task is performed sequentially after another.
      + **WHILE** is a loop (repetition) with a simple conditional test at its beginning.
      + **IF-THEN-ELSE** is a decision (selection) in which a choice is made between two alternative courses of action.
      + **REPEAT-UNTIL** is a loop with a simple conditional test at the bottom.
      + **CASE** is a multiway branch (decision) based on the value of an expression. CASE is a generalization of IF-THEN-ELSE.
  - Several keywords are often used to indicate common input, output, and processing operations.
      + Input: READ, OBTAIN, GET
      + Output: PRINT, DISPLAY, SHOW
      + Compute: COMPUTE, CALCULATE, DETERMINE
      + Initialize: SET, INIT
      + Add one: INCREMENT, BUMP    
  - An example

    **"Adequate"**

        FOR X = 1 to 10
            FOR Y = 1 to 10
                IF gameBoard[X][Y] = 0
                    Do nothing
                ELSE
                    CALL theCall(X, Y) (recursive method)
                    increment counter                  
                END IF
            END FOR
        END FOR

    **"Better"**

        Set moveCount to 1
        FOR each row on the board
            FOR each column on the board
                IF gameBoard position (row, column) is occupied THEN
                    CALL findAdjacentTiles with row, column
                    INCREMENT moveCount
                END IF
            END FOR
        END FOR

# Legacy Shortest path algorithms
 + Dijkstra's [Faster, More thought involved, needs D's greedy criterion]
 + Bellmanford [O(VE), slower but simpler, can get negative weigths also]    

# Coursera 2SUM Problem

 + Tried this using hashmap/Dictionary. improved the O(n^2) solution a bit by breaking immediately as we find a solution pair, removed all duplicates

        Size of the hashtable 999752
        427
        [Finished in 4722.281s]

+ After changing the logic , using the bisect module we can reduce the time crazy good , we find the leftmost and rightmost insert index as the samples array is already sorted for us , so we only need to look at that part of the array

        Size of samples 1000000
        427

# OA Amzn [Qualified]

  + Though process for subsequence problem : [a,b,c,a,b,c,a,d,e,d,e,f,d,g,h,i]

            Keep Extracting from the list given and pushing the new values into a queue or a list .
            Use while loop to shorten up the stack or can also use a for loop
            A = queue.Queue.()
            B = Left out of the sequence/stack
            if set(A)&set(B) :
                keep pushing as still we have the original values inside the queue
            else :
                Nothing is similar between the pushed seq(A) and the left sequences(B) , so you have got the complete sequence, clean the queue and increment counter
                You can store the sequence somewhere also like a list of lists
            return (final value of the counter)

            For the case when the sequence is [a, a, a], you will never reach the else part , for that case you would need to check this case.
            ```
            from collections import deque
            class Solution(object):
                """docstring for Solution."""
                def __init__(self):
                    super(Solution, self).__init__()

                def uniqueseq(self, seq):
                    q,stack,res = deque(seq),[],[]
                    while q:
                        stack.append(q.popleft())
                        if not (set(stack)&set(q)):
                            res.append(stack)
                            stack = []
                    return(len(res))
            obj = Solution()
            seq = ['a','b','c','a','b','c','a','d','e','d','e','f','d','g','h','i','g']
            #seq = ['a','a','a']
            print(obj.uniqueseq(seq))
            ```


# Text Justification [Level - Difficult]

 + Tried the Bottom Up approach , with O(n2) Time complexity , taken help for logic : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RORuwHiblPc
 + Next try memoization/top down approach ie, based on the MIT lecture

# TopologicalSort
 + Added Recurssive reverse DFS  to solve - try 1
 + Non Recurssive based on Kahn's approach - try 2

# Karatsuba recurssion for multiplying large numbers
 + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm
```
def karatsuba(num1, num2):
  if len(num1)==1 or len(num2)==1:return num1*num2
  else:
    mid=max(len(num1),len(num2))/2
    a,b,c,d = num1 // 10^mid , num1%10^mid ,num2 // 10^mid , num2%10^mid
    ac = Karatsuba(a,c)
    bd = karatsuba(b,d)
    z = karatsuba(a+b, c+d) - ac - bd
    return (ac*10^(2*mid))+(z*10^(mid))+(bd)  
```
